I'm a rising graduate at Illinois Tech majoring in Information Technology & Management and summer 2018 student at Stanford specializing in Product Management, IoT.
<br/>
The process of taking a technology and turning into an amazing user experience by defining a product excites me. My professional work experience as a software developer in IoT startup and one of the leading software research labs of India provided me a solid space to turn ideas from inception to tangible products. 
<br/>
With strong engineering background and product management expertise, what I can bring to the table is the unique combination of Skillsets aligned with Product Goal & Positioning, User Experience, Engineering, Data, Business, Technology, Security, Standards & Regulations Area. I pay attention to the details and strategies of what it takes to build a great product the world needs, own the responsibility in driving the product development.
